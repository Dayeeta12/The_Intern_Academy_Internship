# The_Intern_Academy_Internship
This repository contains all my work done as a Python Intern in The Intern Academy's summer internship program.

# Task1:Scheduler_Notifier
## _Create a python scheduler notifier:  
In this project you need to add tasks with a notification time and at that time, it will ring as alarm and notify you about your tasks. Different types of tunes will be used to notify the person. Make a list of those tasks that need to be performed with time intervals and these task will be notified to the user after that particular interval and it will be tuned again and again.


# Task3:Weather_Report
## _Get the weather report of the location by the IP address :  
When you get the location of that region, find the weather report of surrounding area and try to predict the weather of that area for next 3 days.
